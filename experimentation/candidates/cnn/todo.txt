Sprint 2
Goals: Complete candidate models in 2d and 3d that allow for parameter variation in input/output tensor size and recurrent final layer (2d only).

3d:
-Copy code for all raw implementations
-Convert to tflearn where necessary
-Modify 2d convolution operations to 3d

2d:
-Copy code for all raw implementations
-Convert to tflearn where necessary
-Add rnn functionality layers

Later:
-Deal with the transfer learning monster in 2d... Then 3d
