Sprint 2 Goal: 
Complete candidate models in 2d and 3d that allow for parameter variation in input/output tensor size and recurrent final layer (2d only).

| Model        | 2d        | 3d        |
| ------------ |---------- |---------- |
| alexnet      | testing   | testing   |
| highway      | testing   | testing   |
| inception_v3 | testing   | testing   |
| inception_v4 | implement | implement |
| resnet_v2    | testing   | testing   |
| net-in-net   | implement | testing   |

Remaining Tasks:
- Deal with the transfer learning monster in 2d... Then 3d
- Confirm CNN -> RNN connection (reddit post)
- complete testing
