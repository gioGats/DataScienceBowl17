*All file paths relative to /storage/DataScienceBowl17
    (project top-level directory)

=======================================================
COMPLETE
=======================================================

FILES: /deployment_file_structure
MOD: Adapted for fireball.cs.uni.edu filesystem,
    scripted download/structuring/preprocessing,
    and competition submission;

FILES: /DSB17/misc
MOD: Deprecated and NotImplemented warnings

FILES: CLI.py -> nstc
MOD: Updated for Linux CLI functionality

FILES: tbd
MOD: Finished HDF5 implementation for dataset creation

FILES: /DSB17/exp/cand/probability
MOD: Removed probability from model, left to CNN layers

FILES: /DSB17/exp/cand/cnn
MOD: Ignore 2D variants - 2D will use pre-trained CNNs
    in /DSB17/exp/cand/rnn; still needs tweaking/testing
    of 3D models.

FILES: /DSB17/exp/cand/rnn
MOD: Still needs addition of pre-trained CNN models and
    transfer learning code functionality

FILES: /DSB17/exp/cand/preprocess
MOD: TODO lists created for three_d.py, make_dataset.py

FILES: /DSB17/exp
MOD: Added make_2d_clf.py and make_3d_clf.py interfaces
    for building tflearn clf objects with desired params;
    HDF5 implementation for make_datasets.py
